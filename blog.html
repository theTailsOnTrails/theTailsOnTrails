        <data-subtext>Meet Corey, Michael, the CATS(!), and 
            the RV!</data-subtext><br>
        <data-content>Hey there, fellow wanderers! We're Corey and Michael, and 
            we're about to take you on a journey like no other. We recently became 
            the proud owners of a 1984 Fleetwood Southwind RV, marking the beginning
             of our nomadic adventure across the vast landscapes of the United States.
              Buckle up and join us as we traverse the country with our <a href="./media.html">furry 
              companions (click)</a> â€“ <a href="./media.html">Pluto, Romeow, and Phoinix</a> â€“ in tow.
        <br><br>
            The idea of embarking on this epic road trip has been a dream of ours for 
            a long time, and now, with the wheels of destiny, and soon the RV, in motion, 
            we can't wait to share our experiences with you. Our escapades will unfold 
            through various social media platforms, including YouTube, Instagram, and 
            TikTok, so you can virtually hop on board and be part of every twist and turn.
            <br><br>
            
            But our journey isn't just about the miles we'll cover; it's also about 
            discovering the natural beauty and resources scattered across this diverse
             land. As we roam from state to state, we plan to harness the power of 
             nature by extracting essential oils from the resources we encounter. 
             These oils will then be transformed into unique fragrances, capturing the
              essence of each location we visit. From the crisp mountain air to the 
              salty breeze of coastal towns, our fragrances will tell the story of our adventure, 
              and they will be available in limited quantities for sale.
              <br><br>
            
            Currently, our days are filled with the hum of power tools and the frequent meow
             of our feline companions as we (admittedly scratch our heads a lot and) work on transforming our RV into a rolling haven. 
             The first order of business? Replacing an alternator belt and addressing a few 
             mechanical quirks to ensure our journey is as safe and smooth as possible. Once the 
             mechanical aspects are fine-tuned, our focus will shift to the interior of the RV.
             <br><br>
            
            The to-do list may seem endless, but we're tackling each task with enthusiasm and 
            a shared vision of creating a home on wheels that reflects both functionality and extreme
            coziness. From designing a space-efficient kitchen to crafting cozy nooks and climbable pieces for our 
            cats, we're pouring our hearts into every detail. We can't wait to reveal the 
            transformation and show you how a vintage RV can be reborn into a stylish and practical mobile home.
            <br><br>
            
            With wrenches in hand and creative juices flowing, we invite you to follow 
            along as we document the highs, the lows, and everything in between. 
            Whether you're a seasoned traveler, a cat lover, a DIY enthusiast, or 
            simply someone seeking inspiration, we hope our journey resonates with you.
            <br><br>
            
            So, join us as we roll down the highways, chasing sunsets and discovering 
            the hidden gems of America. Your front-row seat to our nomadic life awaits, 
            and we can't wait to share it with you. Here's to the open road and the countless adventures that lie ahead!
